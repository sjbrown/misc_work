# How many moves can I make on my turn?

First of all, Deckahedron World doesn't use *turns* and there is no
"turn order". Those terms are better suited to board games where the
rules strictly dictate play.  Deckahedron World is a narrative game
where everyone contributes to making a story.

Instead of turns, it's the GM's job to *move the spotlight*. Their
judgement will determine how much each player will be able to add before
they start asking questions of a different player at the table.

That said, here are some *guidelines* for moving the spotlight:

 - Each *player* should get their fair share of *time* playing the game
 - Each *character* should get their fair share of *significance* in
   the narrative
 - A player *may* use their time in the spotlight just elaborating on
   the story or having their character do things that do not trigger
   a move
 - *Generally* a player should be limited to one significant move with
   their time in the spotlight. This guideline is more strongly
   encouraged during high-action sequences.
 - Make allowances for moves that have the IMMEDIATE tag.
 - The Critical Flip always lets the player spend a little bit longer
   in the spotlight if they choose to pay the cost.


# Can I spend **1** green token for a flashback without any level of
  advantage?

No.

(Design note: the game is best when players use mechanics for big, *important*
decisions, not tiny, fine-grained decisions)

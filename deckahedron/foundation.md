# Deckahedron Foundation

The **Deckahedron** is a deck of 20 cards to be used as a tool.
**The Deckahedron System** is a system for playing Role Playing Games.

If you've never played a Role Playing Game before, please read
the introduction,
[Deckahedron System for the Absolute Beginner](absolute_beginner.md).

The Deckahedron System is split up into the *foundation* and the *modules*.
This document is the foundation.  The other documents describe the
modules -- optional additions to the rules.  You can keep your
game sessions simple by just using this foundation, or you can
add depth and interesting choices by including some modules.

# Why modules?

One goal of Deckahedron is to make RPGs accessible to new players, so
it is very important that these new players have a great, exciting first
experience.  Most exciting stuff happens *during play*, so by starting
simply, the players can get into the adventure sooner.

A typical first game with 4 players should have a 20-minute rules explanation,
and character creation should take around 30 minutes.  The adventure
should begin before the first hour is over.

# Modules List

 * [Combat](mod_combat.md).
 * [Characters](mod_characters.md).
 * [Character Classes and Levels](mod_levels.md).



# Core Storytelling Mechanism: Attempts and Resolution

The game starts by introducing the setting and the characters.

 * The Storyteller (or GM) gives a description of the setting
 * Each player distributes 6 points into the **Strength**, **Intelligence**,
   and **Dexterity** ranks of their character (see below)
 * Each player takes a minute or two to introduce the character they're
   playing.  The character's name, background, motivations, and special skills
 * The players and the Storyteller can also discuss how the characters
   know each other, and what situation bonds them together for this adventure

As the game is played, each player controls a character, and contributes
to the shared story by saying what their character thinks, feels and does.
Together with the Storyteller, the players create an improvisational
back-and-forth as they lead their characters into dangerous situations
and interpersonal conflicts.

At key moments though, the players themselves won't be able to simply declare
the results of their character's actions, and must look to the Storyteller
to find out "what happens next?". This happens at any point that a
character is **attempting** to do something where there's a chance of
failure.  It can also happen spontaneously with the Storyteller springing a
trap or adding a new twist to the story.

# Core Resolution Mechanic: Character Stats

Characters will have *stats*, **Strength**, **Dexterity**,
and **Intelligence**.  Each will have a rank from 1 (worst) to 4 (best).

(If you want a richer representation of characters, see the
[Characters Module](mod_characters.md)
)

When a character attempts an action that is governed by physical strength,
like lifting a heavy gate, the Strength rank will determine the action's
success.

When a character attempts an action that is governed by their reaction
time, nervous system, and fast-twitch muscles,
like leaping onto a running buffalo, the Dexterity rank will
determine the action's success.

When a character attempts an action that is governed by that
grey glob sloshing around in their skull,
like finding clues in an ancient book, the Intelligence
rank will determine the action's success.

# Core Resolution Mechanic: The Deckahedron

The **resolution deck** (or simply "Deckahedron") is made of 20
square cards.
Each edge of a card has a number, so it can be connected to a
rank of a character's *stat*.

Back of card                      | Front of card
----------------------------------|----------------------------------------
![Card Back](images/back_200.png) | ![Card Front](images/front_19_200.png)

 1. A stat with the rank of 1 is connected to the red edge of the
    Deckahedron, which shows 1 pip
    (and an "Anchor" symbol on the back of the card)
 2. Rank 2 stats are connected to the yellow edge, which shows 2
    pips (and a "Bulb" symbol).
 3. Rank 3 stats are connected to the green edge, which shows 3
    pips (and a "Crescent" symbol)
 4. Rank 4 stats are connected to the blue edge, which shows 4
    pips (and a "Dart" symbol)

Whenever a character attempts an action, the player flips one card
[ * ](#multi-card-flips)
and reads the result from the card, printed as either ✗ or ✔ symbols.

A simple example:

 1. The character attempts an action governed by Strength
 2. The player flips over the top card in their Deckahedron
 3. The character has a strength rank of 3
 4. So the player looks to the edge marked with 3 pips,
    (the "green" or "Crescent" edge)
    and reads the ✗ or ✔ symbols on that edge
 5. If those symbols are:
   * ✗✗: the attempt was a categorical failure
   * ✗: the attempt was a failure
   * ✔: the attempt was a success
   * ✔✔ : the attempt was an unconditional success
 6. The Storyteller then interprets the result.

The interpretation by the Storyteller is the key final step.  It's a
Storyteller's job to take the result from the Deckahedron and turn it
into narrative.  Maybe that means seeing a ✗✗ and declaring that the
character not only failed, but also injured themselves or alerted their
foes and gave away their position. The Storyteller should describe the
new scenario, perhaps touching on some potential paths forward or choices
in front of the characters, and then ask "What do you do?"

## Multi Card Flips

The Storyteller may deem a challenge to be particularly difficult or
particularly easy.  Instead of flipping one card, the player will flip
multiple and take either the best or the worst result.

Difficulty of challenge | Resolution method
------------------------|------------------------------
Very easy               | flip 3 cards, take the best
Easy                    | flip 2 cards, take the best
Standard                | flip 1 card
Difficult               | flip 2 cards, take the worst
Very difficult          | flip 3 cards, take the worst


## Reshuffling

If a player ends their turn with *5 or fewer* cards in their Deckahedron,
they **must** reshuffle their discard pile back into the Deckahedron.

Otherwise, used cards do not necessarily have to get reshuffled into
the Deckahedron. A player can keep used cards face up in a "discard" pile
next to the Deckahedron.  Similarly, a Player can choose to reshuffle
their Deckahedron after any action.

This allows the players a small degree of control over their *luck*, and
prevents unhappy players frustrated by repeated failures.

## Rationale: Cards versus Dice

Many other Role Playing Games use dice instead of cards.

Here are some of the reasons the Deckahedron system chooses cards for the
core resolution mechanic:

 * Visibility: helps the GM scale the challenges
 * Visibility: helps the GM see what opportunities to open up for the players
   * Clearly if a player choose a skill, they want an opportunity to use it
 * Arithmetic sucks
   * "Flip 3, take the best" is easier than "roll 2d6, add your Strength bonus"
 * One action (a "flip") can result in many values
   (so the cards can be "multi-dimensional")
 * [Thematic flips](mod_thematic_flips.md)
 * Cheap and portable
 * Cards open up richer game play mechanics
   * hiding values
   * player choice about when to shuffle can be interesting
   * look at top *n* cards, and put them back in any order
   * drafting
   * backs of cards can be marked
   * collect special cards
   * deckbuilding mechanic
   * cards can be written on
   * Spot It / Dobble mechanic

# Deckahedron Module: Characters


## How to represent a character

A character will be represented by a simple **character sheet** and a
collection of **cards** which represent a richer list of the character's
attributes.

When playing, you should also keep notes for information
about the character that isn't covered by your character sheet and cards.

It can also be fun to draw a picture of the character and keep that handy.

### Character Sheet

A sheet displaying

#### The character's **name**
#### The character's **stats**:
  * **Strength** (STR)
   - This represents the rank of the character's musculoskeletal system
  * **Dexterity** (DEX)
   - This represents the rank of the character's fast twitch muscles, fine motor skills, and reaction time
  * **Intelligence** (INT)
   - This represents the rank of the character's brain (and heart, if you feel so poetic)

Each *stat* has a rank: 1. `Anchor` (red), 2. `Bulb` (yellow),
3. `Crescent` (green), or 4. `Dart` (blue).
The rank of the stat will determine which side of the Deckahedron to flip.

> If your character is attempting deduce their own position using a
> map written in a foreign language, they would do a flip using
> their `intelligence` rank.  Let's say they were a dumb Orc, and their
> `intelligence` was the lowest rank, `Anchor`. They would flip the `Anchor`
> side of the Deckahedron and reveal whether or not they succeeded.

### Character Attribute Cards

A collection of cards describing the "built-in" attributes of your character.
These may be things like "Charming Smile", "Stubborn", "Good Cardio",
"Dwarf", "Elf", "Member of Engineering Guild".

These are usually things that could be called "facts" about a character.

Attribute cards can sometimes provide flip bonuses, or make it easier to
level up in different skills.  They can also weave into the narrative. A
good GM finds ways to make character attributes impact the story.

Unlike `Skill Cards`, `Attribute Cards` don't get better with practice,
and their advantages don't increase and decrease with `bonus` and `penalty`
cards.

### Character Skill Cards

A collection of cards describing the learned skills of the character.
These may be things with obvious analogs in our world like "Swimming" or
"Geometry", or they could be things that require a little bit more
thought to interpret how they matter in the narrative world players create,
like "Dirty Tricks" or "Infiltration". They could also be highly-specific
and highly poetic concepts like "Eye of the Tiger" and "Leeroy Jenkins".

Skill cards can have just about any mechanical or narrative effect on the game.

## Getting better with practice

### Initial skills:

Your character will begin the game already proficient in a few
skills.  See the [How to create a character](#how-to-create-a-character)
section.

### Learning a new skill:

 * Start brand new skills With 3 `penalty` cards

---

A character, just like a real-life human, can attempt any skill they've
seen before. But, without practice, instruction or very careful observation,
they are probably going to fail when they try a new skill.

To attempt a brand new skill, just confirm with the GM that your character has
seen the skill used before, then take the skill card, put 3 `penalty` cards on
top of it. Flip **4** cards, and take the **worst** result.

The character probably failed, but don't worry, they just need to keep
practicing.

> **Note:** Doing a skill check with 3 `penalty` cards by flipping `Darts`
> (blue) only gives you a 9.7% chance to succeed.  If a player is slowing
> the game down by repeatedly attempting many highly penalized Skills,
> "house rules" are encouraged.  One such rule might be that a character
> can only have a maximum of 6 `penalty` cards among all their skills.

At any point, you can discard the skill and penalty cards back into the decks
they came from. But if your character attempts that skill again, they will
do so as if it were a brand new skill.

### Becoming "proficient":

 * With 3 `penalty` cards, flip **4**, take the **worst**
 * With 2 `penalty` cards, flip **3**, take the **worst**
 * With 1 `penalty` card, flip **2**, take the **worst**
 * With no cards on top of the skill, simply flip **1** card

---

A character lacks proficiency with a skill when there are `penalty` cards
top of the skill card.

When you declare you're using a skill and then flip cards to reveal your
result, there may be a green `proficiency` symbol in the middle of the 
result card.
(*Note:* if this was a flip that required you to flip multiple cards and
take the worst result, only that "worst result" card's proficiency symbol
counts)
If the `proficiency` symbol is present, then, *despite the success or
failure*, you get a reward!  Choose either:

 * You can take a green token and place it on top of your character sheet.
 * Your practice paid off and you just got a little better at the skill.
   Therefore, you can now spend a green token on your character sheet to
   discard one of the `penalty` cards on top of the skill card.

By this means, the character gets better and better at that skill until
there are no more `penalty` cards on top of the skill card.  We can then
say that the character is "**proficient**" at the skill.


### Becoming an "expert"

 * With 1 `bonus` card, flip **2**, take the **best**

---

Even after proficiency is achieved, practice still makes perfection
asymtotically closer.

When you declare you're using a skill the character is proficient at,
and then flip a card to reveal your result, if there's a `proficiency`
symbol, *despite the success or failure*, you can choose:

 * Take a green token and place it on top of your character sheet.
 * Spend a green token from your character sheet to take a `bonus`
   card and put it on top of that skill.

With a `bonus` card on a skill, you may now flip **2** cards and take the
**best** result.

### Becoming a "master"

 * With 2 `bonus` cards, flip **3**, take the **best**

---

When you declare you're using a skill the character is an expert at,
and then flip 2 cards to reveal your result, if there's a `proficiency`
symbol on **both** of the cards (*Not* just the result card), and *despite
the success or failure*, you can choose:

 * Take a green token and place it on top of your character sheet.
 * Spend a green token from your character sheet to take a `bonus`
   card and put it on top of that skill.

With two `bonus` cards on a skill, you may now flip **3** cards and take the
**best** result.


### Learning from a master

See the [Leveling Up Module](mod_levels.md)
for ways that characters can increase their skill proficiency outside
of the action of an adventure.

## How to create a character

For `n` players, the GM will distribute `n*3 + 1` Attribute and Skill
cards to each player. Players will then draft cards until they hold 1
card.  That last card is discarded.

`TODO`

## Rationale: Cards for Skills and Attributes

 * Visibility: helps the GM see what opportunities to open up for the players
  - Clearly if a player choose a skill, they want an opportunity to use it

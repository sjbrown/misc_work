# At character generation

Players start with 6 tokens. They decide how they want to distribute
them among the columns.

Characters cannot have more than 4 in any column.

Columns can go down to 0.

# During an adventure

* One token from the Equipment column can be discarded to add one
  token to the Speed column
* One token from the Wealth column can be discarded to add one token
  to the Speed column
* If the character takes some new Wealth, they add one token to the
  Wealth column and remove one from the Speed column
* If the character takes some new Equipment, they add one token to the
  Equipment column and remove one from the Speed column


## Equipment

During an adventure you can remove a token from the Equipment column and
declare "Good thing I remembered to bring ..." and then describe what the
piece of equipment is and how it helps you in your situation.  The GM
will tell you whether you immediately succeed, or if you need to flip to
check for success.

eg: "Good thing I remembered to bring 50ft of rope!"


## Speed

Speed is for calculating travel times and outrunning enemies.

If you're using the Item Card module, some cards may indicate that you
must spend a Speed token to carry the item.


### Bravely Run Away!

Here's an example from
[Deckahedron World](mod_deckahedron_world.md)
of how Speed can work in a game.

There is a move called "Bravely Run Away!". You can use this move to escape
foes in the middle of combat unless the Storyteller has declared you are
surrounded or cornered, or unless the foe(s) you face have some special
power that makes them unescapable.

When you use this move, it costs stamina to run away.  The formula to
calculate the stamina lost is `4 - Speed`.  So if your character has 4
points in Speed, no stamina will be lost. But with 0 points in Speed,
this will cost your character 4 stamina.


# Visiting a merchant

* Spend a Wealth token to buy two equipment tokens
* If using the Item Card module, spend a Wealth token to buy an item card
* You can sell a piece of "heavy" equipment to a merchant for "light"
  currency - discard 1 Equipment token, add 1 Speed token and 1 Wealth
  token

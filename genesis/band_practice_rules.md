Playtest version VERSION

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! : Band Practice is a game for 3 players,
so gather two other friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

`TODO: diagram`

 * 15 6-sided dice
 * 3 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the deck)
     - Boom die (faces: 2,2,4,4,4,4)
     - Stereo die (faces: 1,2,3,4,5,6)
     - Charm die (faces: 4,5,5,6,7,7)
 * 8 Meeples (meeples and markers can be coins or glass beads)
 * 15 red discs (or coins)
 * 3 Player Markers (1 each for Beats, Melody and Front)
 * 3 Player Role cards
 * Deck of Band Practice cards
 * Game Board sheet
 * Song sheets

Place three Player Markers, Beats, Melody, and Front, at the top of the 
Game Board sheet in the spot marked Start.

Shuffle the Band Practice deck and place it face-down near the Game Board.
Flip 2 cards over.

The Band Practice songs sheets are labelled with levels, I, II, and III.

You will play songs I-a, I-b, and I-c first.

Shuffle the level II song sheets and place them face-down. You will play
them in a random order.

Shuffle the level III song sheets, randomly remove one of them, and place
the other two face-down.  You will play only two level III songs.


### Forming your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, holding steady the percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, pouring out a river of auditory colors. And one will play the **Front**
role, braving the top of the stage and interacting with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role. Then each player should take the matching
Role card.


## The Goal

Your band is practicing at the local tavern. If your practice songs sound
good enough to capture the interest of passers-by on the street, and they
come into the tavern, you may get an opportunity for a paid Gig!

You will play 8 songs, and if you play a song flawlessly, a patron (meeple)
will enter the tavern.

Every round you will:

 * Play a Song
 * Try not to make any mistakes
 * Try to set foot in the spotlight


## Playing a Song

To play a song, set the song sheet within reach of all the players.
On the song sheet are columns of squares. Each column is called a *Song Part*.

The bottom row is for the **Beats** player, the middle, for the **Melody**
player, and the top for the **Front** player.
Like bars of music, *Song Parts* are played in order, from left-to-right.

The player whose square is at the bottom of the *Song Part* starts it by
rolling dice. Usually, this will be the **Beats** player.

This player gathers dice, as many as the number of squares in the
column. *If this is the first Song Part of a song, they add one more die*.
(If the first *Song Part* has 3 squares, they will take 4 dice)
Then they roll them all and place them into the "Dice Pool".

That same player then gets to choose one die from the Dice Pool and
place it into their square in the *Song Part*. From bottom to top, the other
players take a turn choosing one die from the Dice Pool and putting
it into their square (scoring Goal Circles as they go - see below) until
all squares in the column are full.

After a die is placed in a square, check if any Goal Circles that touch
that square *trigger* (see next section).

> Players aged 12 years and younger may remove a die and rethink their move
> after the die has touched their square. Otherwise, dice cannot be removed
> from a square until the song is finished.

### Goal Circles

The starting four Goal Circles:

 * Equals ⊜
    - Trigger: there are dice on both sides
    - Success: the die on the left *equals* the die on the right
    - Score: the value of one of the adjacent dice
 * Up arrow ↗
    - Trigger: there are dice on both sides
    - Success: the die on the left is *less than* the die on the right
    - Score: the value of the *right* die minus the *left* die
 * Down arrow ↘
    - Trigger: there are dice on both sides
    - Success: the die on the left is *greater than* the die on the right
    - Score: the value of the *left* die minus the *right* die
 * Pose
    - Trigger: there is a die on the square
    - Success: the die is *greater than* **one** of the other dice in
      the column (or, this die is the **only** die in the column)
    - Score: the value of this die minus the *lowest in the column*
      (or the value of this die, if it is the **only** die in the column)

If placing a die in the square *triggers* a Goal Circle, and that Goal
Circle "succeeds", then that Goal Circle scores!

If a Goal Circle gets triggered, but it does not succeed, that means **there
is a mistake in the song**. Place a red disc on the Goal Circle that failed
and place a second red disc on the oldest available card. (If no cards are
available, you don't need to place a second red disc)

When you score, move your Player Marker around the Stage. Step your marker
into the numbered circles, taking one step for every point scored.

Just as two musicians can't be in the same spot on the stage, Player Markers
can't ever be in the same spot either, so, if there's a Player Marker occupying
the next spot, just skip over them.

> For example, if your Player Marker was in the "Start" spot, and another
> player's was in the "3" spot, and you scored 3 points, your marker would
> end up on the "4" spot.

When your marker "*sets foot*" in the spotlight, you may take **one** of
these actions:

 * Take a card (place it face-up in front of you)
 * Flip over two new cards
 * Remove a red disc

If your Player Marker is in the spotlight at the end of your turn, you are
**hogging the spotlight**.  When other player markers are stepping around
the stage, they will have to skip the spotlight, and won't be able to take
one of the above three actions.

### Finishing the song

For every *Song Part* in the song, this process is repeated: the starting
player gathers dice, rolls them, adds them to the Dice Pool, then each
player with a square in the column chooses and places a die.

After a *Song Part* is complete, there will usually be one unchosen die.
That die stays in the Dice Pool. When the *song* is over, the Dice Pool
is cleared.

### Using Cards

As you play an original song, you can use the special powers on the
cards you've taken to make things easier or give yourself a boost.

Cards must be used:

 * On your turn
 * Before you place a die into a square

Each one of these powers can be used **once per song**. After using a power,
rotate that card, or place a marker on it.

### Technical difficulties

**If there are no dice left in the Dice Pool** for a player to place in
their square, and they do not have any special dice to add to the Dice
Pool, then the song immediately ends, and any unmarked Goal Circles
remaining are marked failed.


## Succeeding or Failing Songs

When you finish a song, if there are no red discs on the song sheet, then
you've performed admirably enough to draw a patron into the Bar.  Take a
meeple and place them next to the stage.

**Do not move your Player Markers back to Start**. Leave your player markers
in their current position on the stage and start the next song from those
positions.


## Final results

| Score         | Result |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0 | The kind of performance people tell their grandkids about |
| 1 | We don't have to walk far to drown our sorrows |
| 2 | Well, that's why we practice |
| 3 | There was no volume in the monitors or something |
| 4 | Don't quit your day job |
| 5 | Quit your day job |
| 6 | That crowd loved us! |
| 7 | Maybe you've got a shot at the Battle of the Bands |
| 8 | Vishnu invites you to fill in for his house band |



## Silent Song Variant

For an extra level of intensity, try playing with this rule:

Players cannot talk after the first dice roll in each song, until that song
is finished.

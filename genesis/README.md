# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

A board game about being in a rock band that might break up!

Take your band from open mic nights at local dives all the way to rocking
stadium concerts in this semi-cooperative board game. Play songs
using a unique dice-drafting mechanism to win the attention of an
audience of meeples. When all the meeples are dancing to the music,
unlock higher-level gigs and advance your career. Between gigs, write
new songs, improve your musical skills, or get mixed up in some dramatic
shenanigans with the Ambition Cards.
Only two things can stop you - not pleasing your audience, or one of
your fellow bandmates getting an inflated head and deciding to "Go Solo"
and break up the band. If that happens, hope luck is on your side for
one final roll-off where the winner gets to preserve their character's
progress and use them again in the next game.

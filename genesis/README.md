# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

A board game about being in a rock band that might break up!

Take your band from open mic nights at local dives all the way to rocking
stadium concerts in this semi-cooperative board game. Play songs
using a unique dice-drafting mechanism to win the attention of an
audience of meeples. When all the meeples are dancing to the music,
unlock higher-level gigs and advance your career. Between gigs, write
new songs, improve your musical skills, or get mixed up in some dramatic
shenanigans with the Ambition Cards.
Only two things can stop you - not pleasing your audience, or one of
your fellow bandmates getting an inflated head and deciding to "Go Solo"
and break up the band. If that happens, hope luck is on your side for
one final roll-off where the winner gets to preserve their character's
progress and use them again in the next game.

# FAQ

## What is the core experience?

The core experience is the cooperative dice-drafting puzzle
called "Playing a Song"

**Why would someone want to play this game?**

 * They are engaged by the narrative of being in a rock band
 * They are engaged by the drama of players being able to betray the team
 * The unique and satisfying experience of Playing a Song

**Where is the fun for the players?**

 * Challenge - The unique and satisfying experience of Playing a Song
 * Serotonin - The satisfaction of increasing their personal character's
   power, a character that might even persist between games
 * Expression - Writing songs / naming the band / characters / songs
 * Emergent narrative - Expounding on the arc of their band's career,
   expounding on the backstory and after-effects of Ambition Cards
 * Fellowship - solving the Playing a Song puzzle and making career
   decisions with their friends.

**Who is your target audience?**

 * 30-60 years old
 * "Western" - familiarity with cliches about rock bands that break up
 * Anyone who's enjoyed VH1 Behind The Music or This Is Spinal Tap
 * Anyone who's ever dreamed of becoming a professional musician or any
   sort of life "on stage".

**What makes this game different from other games on the market?**

 * The dice-drafting mechanism. Closest thing is Sagrada
 * It's semi-cooperative in a new way. Players can always choose to stay
   aligned "as a team". But any single player can decide to Go Solo at
   the end of any round.

**Do all game mechanics support the experience?**

Yes

**Is the duration appropriate for the experience?**

Yes

**Are there things for players to learn and get better at?**

Yes

**Is this appropriate for the length and experience of the game?**

Yes

**What are the decision points in the game?**

 * Biggest one is "Go Solo" or not - every round
 * During "Playing a Song":
   - which dice to draft
   - how far to move the player piece
   - whether to use powers / which powers to use
   - whether to talk or not (unless playing on Easy mode)
 * During "Grind between Gigs":
   - which action to select
   - how much to spend
   - which song to write / which writing reward to take

**How do the players interact with each other?**

 * Go Solo
 * Playing a Song:
   - hog the spotlight
   - leapfrog
   - (Normal mode) start talking - costs a Yawn
   - take dice from the communal dice pool
   - use powers to affect the dice pool
 * Grind between Gigs:
   - taking limited action-selection spots (worker-placement-ish)
   - taking limited song composition slots / song powers
   - playing Ambition Cards (and storytelling around those)


## Mechanics

**Are the mechanics fresh and innovative?**

Yes

**Are they too innovative?**

No - in playtests, they are picked up quickly. It's especially smooth
because a lot of it aligns with player expectations about playing music

**Are there moves/actions that players always take?**

Only situationally, and then, only if a player is sufficiently skilled

**Can these be eliminated or changed?**

Maybe.  It would probably remove a reward of learning the skill.

**Do you give players incentives to do interesting things?**

Yes

**Will a new player have an idea of what a good play is early in the game?**

In playtests, new players have *an idea*, sometimes they're wrong. Usually
by round 2 or 3 all players are 80% there, but at that point they're also
discovering new things which make them adjust their earlier heuristics.

**Can any mechanics be eliminated or simplified?**

Maybe

**Which mechanics are not intuitive?**

The difference between Admirers (personal) and Fans (group) takes a little
explaining.  Also, there's nothing specifically *intuitive* about the action
selection scarcity in the Grind Between Gigs, but it's minimally intrusive
and I've seen playtesters create narrative justification for it organically.

**Are you taking appropriate steps to explain / ease players in?**

I think so - Band Practice goes a long way here.

**Are there any degenerate/extreme strategies?**

I'll keep playtesting, but haven't found any.

**Is there a dominant strategy?**

Yes, but it's socially disincentivized. The group can aim, from the beginning
to play a few games whose sole purpose is to create well-powered characters,
who persist through to the proceeding games. Finally the group would use
those characters to play a game, and barring extreme bad luck or low skill,
they should be able to win.

**Are the start positions sufficiently balanced?**

I think so.  More playtests needed.

**Is the winner in doubt until the end of the game?**

Yes

**Is there a snowball effect?**

Players are charged with mitigating another player who is poised to snowball.

**What drives the game towards a conclusion?**

The Gig Deck serves as a "countdown clock" - when players don't have any
unlocked gigs, they lose.



## Graphics / Production

**What is your price point?**

TBD

Yes, in a sense.  The game is designed with a "Band Practice" variant.

# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

A board game about being a band of amateur musicians that make it big!

Take your band from amateurs jamming in the garage all the way to rocking
stadium concerts in this mostly-cooperative board game. Create unique
musicians and a discography of amazing (or absurd) tracks, then use
dice-drafting to play a career of gigs to achieve greater and greater
success... unless one of you kills the dream to go solo and win it all for
themselves!

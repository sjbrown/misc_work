# Pitch:

Genesis of Destiny Supreme is the game about being in a rock band that
might break up! You and your bandmates play gigs via a dice-drafting
mechanism and improve your characters, aiming to headline the
Bonchellsquatch Music Festival and win the game. Looming over every round
though is the possibility that one of your fellow bandmates might break up
the band and try to win by "Going Solo"

# 4th-level powers

## Beats

   available dice to anything you want

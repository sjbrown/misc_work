Playtest version VERSION

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! is a game for 3 players, so gather two other
friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

 * 15 6-sided dice (it's possible to play the game with 4 if you don't have 15)
 * 15 Meeples (these can be any marker, like coins or glass beads)
 * 7 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the Write and Riff deck)
     - 3 Beats dice (faces: 2,2,4,4,4,4)
     - 2 Melody dice (faces: 1,2,3,4,5,6)
     - 2 Front dice (faces: 4,5,5,6,7,7)
 * Band sheet
 * Song sheets
 * Character sheets
 * Live the Life / Write and Riff sheet
 * Deck of Gig cards
 * Deck of Write and Riff cards
 * Deck of Event cards
 * 3 Pencils
 * 3 different colored felt-tip pens (optional)

When you draw permanent marks that are role-related, it can be useful to
use a colored felt-tip pen, with each role assigned a specific color.

### Forming your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, holding the line of percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, pouring out a river of auditory colors. And one will play the **Front**
role, braving the spotlight and interacting with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role, then take a character sheet and fill in
some of the blanks:

 * write down the name of your character
 * decide what specific musical instrument your character plays and write it down
 * circle your role
 * (optional) draw a portrait of your character
 * Live the Life for a cost of 0 COMMITMENT and fill in one bubble in either
   your Intensity or your Craft track.

Take the Band sheet and give yourselves a band name.

Your band starts its career with one original song. Name the song and write
it down on the song sheet.

Your band's career is made up of a series of "Gigs". In this game, you draw
Gig cards, play a Gig, do a downtime activity, go to the studio, then start
over again, until the game ends.


## Winning the game

There are 2 ways to win the game, either by staying together and becoming
musical legends, or by unleashing your star power, and going solo to win all
the glory for yourself.

If your band plays a Gig and achieves "✰✰✰✰" as the outcome, the band has
become legendary and you all have won the game together.  Congratulations!

If instead, during the event card phase, any player plays the "Go Solo!"
card, then the band is broken up and only **one** player will win, as decided
by the [breaking up the band](#breaking-up-the-band) mini-game.

If it comes time to play a Gig, but there are no Gig cards to choose from,
then the game is over and your band dwindles into obscurity, their songs
becoming curiosities for a few well-researched DJs.

## Playing a Gig

When the game begins, you will play your first Gig, "Open Mic Night at Vishnu's".

Subsequent Gigs will be chosen from the unlocked Gig cards.

In the upper right corner, there are requirements for playing that Gig. These
requirements are a number of "Crowd" the band must have, or a "Coin" cost to
get access to the Gig. The Gig "Open Mic Night at Vishnu's" has a blank
upper right corner, meaning there are no requirements.

Every Gig card has a number underneath its title that says how many meeples are
in the music venue.  Take that many meeples and place them at the "Bar" area on
the game board.

Underneath the meeples, the number of songs you must play is written.

Your goal will be to move meeples from the Bar area up to the Stage area,
moving and grooving to the music.  And you definitely don't want them outside
on the Patio area, bored and thinking about their life choices.

The instruction "**move a meeple up**" means move a meeple from the
Bar area to the Stage area, or move a meeple from the Patio area to
the Bar area. If all meeples are in the Stage area, do nothing.

The instruction "**move a meeple down**" means move a meeple from the
Stage area to the Bar area, or move a meeple from the Bar area to
the Patio area. If all meeples are in the Patio area, do nothing.

Playing "covers", "originals", and "recorded originals" will give you chances
to move meeples up closer to the stage, but mistakes and bad luck could cause
them to move further away.

Also, these meeples get thirsty.  Some Gig cards indicates how many meeples will
move from the Stage area to the Bar area between songs. These meeples move down
after every song, whether the song is a cover or an original.  The only way to
stop meeples from moving down during a lull is to have a player be in the
Spotlight (see Playing Originals below).

### Playing Covers

Playing Covers must be done **before** playing any Originals.
To play a cover, just roll a six-sided die, then look at the Covers section of
the Gig card.
If the result is **equal to or above** the top number, then a meeple moves **up**.
If the result is **equal to or below** the bottom number, then a meeple moves **down**.

### Playing Recorded Originals

Recording your own songs (see Studio phase below) means you've had a lot
of practice and the audience is familiar with them, so you can get
consistent results.

If you choose to play a Recorded Original, look to your song sheet where you
wrote down the Studio results. Just move the number of meeples indicated up,
then in order from top-to-bottom, move each player's marker around the stage
the amount indicated, collecting "10 chips" just as you would when playing an
Original.

You cannot play an original more than once per gig, whether it is recorded
or not.

### Playing Originals

To play an Original, set the song sheet in the middle of the table.
On the song sheet are columns of squares. Each column is called a "song part".

The bottom row is for the **Beats** player, the middle, for the **Melody**
player, and the top for the **Front** player.
Like bars of music, you will play song parts in order, from left-to-right.

The player whose square is at the bottom of the song part starts it.
This is usually the **Beats** player.

This player gathers six-sided dice, equal to the number of squares in the
column. *If this is the first song part of a song, they add one more die*.
Then they roll them all and place them into the "Dice Pool" area.

That same player then gets to choose one die from the Dice Pool and
place it into their square in the song part. From bottom to top, the other
players take a turn choosing one die from the Dice Pool and putting
it into their square until all squares in the column are full.

Players aged 12 years and younger may remove a die and rethink their move
after the die has touched their square. Otherwise, dice cannot be removed
from a square until the song is finished.

Once a die is placed in a square, that die scores.

#### Scoring a die

To score a die, look at each circle that touches the square.

After a song part is complete, there will usually be one unchosen die.
That die stays in the Dice Pool.

For every song part in the song, this process is repeated: the starting
player takes 1-3 dice, rolls them, adds them to the Dice Pool, then each player
with a square in the column chooses and places a die.

You cannot play an original more than once per gig.


#### Technical difficulties

**If there are no dice left in the available pool** and a player needs to
place a die in their square, and they do not have any special dice to add
to the available pool, then the song immediately ends, and no gig points or
individual points are scored.

### Using Craft or Intensity powers

TODO 

#### Intensity

 1. Re-roll - use this power on your turn. You must re-roll all the dice in the
    available pool
 2. Double-up - when you are picking your die from the available pool, take
    two dice instead of one and put them both in your square.
 3. Sustain - at the moment your turn would normally be skipped because the
    song part doesn't have an open square for you, place your sustain marker
    where your square would normally be, and take a turn

#### Craft

 1. Bump - Use this power on your turn. Change the value of one die in the
    available pool up or down by 1. Eg, change a 4 to a 5 or 3. (You
    cannot change a 1 to a 6 or vice versa)
 2. Clone - Use this power on your turn. Change the value of one die in the
    available pool to be the value of a die that was just placed in a square
    by the previous player
 3. Extra cards - if you buy a Write and Riff card during the Downtime phase,
    also take 2 cards from the top of the deck when the Downtime phase ends

### Counting points from an original song

The circles on the song sheet are what score points for players.

The band starts with one original song with the following circles:

 * Equals - This scores points for the **Beats** player. If the two dice
   adjacent to the circle are equal, add the points from each die. The
   **Beats** player scores that amount.
 * Up arrow - This scores points for the **Melody** player. Subtract the
   *right* die from the *left* die. The **Melody** player scores that amount.
 * Down arrow - This scores points for the **Melody** player. Subtract the
   *left* die from the *right* die. The **Melody** player scores that amount.
 * Crown - This scores points for the **Front** player. Subtract the Front
   die from the lowest of the other dice in the column. The **Front** player
   scores that amount.

Write down each players individual score. Then add each player's score
to the gig score.

### Distributing your gig score points

Every gig card has a chart that tells you what gig score you need to get
to get ✰ (or whether you bomb).

When the chart shows CROWD, COIN, or CLOUT points, add those to the respective
boxes on your band sheet.

If you gain CLOUT, you might unlock new Gig cards - add them to the
"unlocked" Gig deck.

### Distributing your individual score points

At the end of a gig, if the members got individual scores, they can split those
points into their CROWD, COMMITMENT, and COIN boxes on their character sheets.

However, each player may only distribute points into boxes that have the (GIG)
text inside them. For example, the Front player may only put their individual
score points into their COIN or CROWD boxes.

You don't have to show how you are splitting up your points until everyone
declares that they've finished.

Points in COIN and COMMITMENT can be spent during the Downtime and Studio
phases. CROWD points can be used to qualify for new gigs.


## Downtime Phase

Every band member chooses how they want to devote their down-time between
gigs. They must choose to either Live the Life, or Write and Riff. They
cannot do both in one round. (They may also choose to skip)

 * Players take turns in order of highest CROWD

 * The band's COIN can be spent on any expense, by any band member, at any time

### Live the Life

When a musician hangs out with their buddies, and trades tricks with their
peers, they gain new skills to apply to their performances.

Players can spend COMMITMENT to go up levels in either Intensity or
Craft. When you go up a level, fill in an Intensity or Craft bubble on your
character sheet. A bubble is only allowed to be filled in if all the
bubbles to its left are filled in.

The first level (which costs 0) should have been taken when the game
began.

When you go up a level, move your character's marker up to the next box
on the Live the Life track.

A player can move up the track multiple spaces if they have enough
COMMITMENT to spend.

The COMMITMENT cost to fill in a new bubble is printed next to the spaces
on the track. You can play on "Normal" or "Expert" mode to adjust the
difficulty.

### Write and Riff

When a musician devotes their downtime to coming up with new song ideas
and trying out new techniques in the practice room, they emerge ready to
collaborate on writing new songs.

At the beginning of the game, shuffle the Write and Riff deck, then place
it face-down to the right of the Write and Riff sheet. Take four cards
from the top of the deck and place them face-up in the $5, $15, $25, and $35
slots.

Discards should be placed face-up to the left of the Write and Riff sheet.

When a player chooses Write and Riff for their downtime phase, they can take
these actions as many times as they want:

 * Buy a face-up card with COIN
 * Spend 2 COMMITMENT to discard the $5 card
 * Spend 6 COMMITMENT to discard all the face-up cards

Any time a hole opens up from discarding or buying a face-up card,
move left any cards on the right of the hole, then place the top card of
the deck face-up in the open slot.

If a card indicates a certain role (Beats, Melody, or Front), only a player
with that role can buy the card.

If the player buys a DIE card, they immediately take that die from the supply
and put the card into the discard pile. Otherwise the player takes the card
into their "hand". A player can choose whether to let the other players see
their hand.

## Band Meeting Phase

As band members finish Living the Life or Writing and Riffing, they draw a
card from the top of the Events deck. When the Band Meeting phase begins,
players should have 2 event cards, their "Chill" card and the card they just
drew.

Players may discuss a plan before looking at their drawn Event card, but
once they have looked at their Event card, they may not speak until after the
Event or Chill cards are revealed.

Players look at their Event cards, they choose either their Event or Chill
card to play, they place that chosen card face-down on the table in front of
them.  When all players have chosen, the cards are revealed simultaneously.
Then the effects of any Event cards are executed.

## Studio Phase

In the studio, bands can gather all the song parts that they've individually
created and patch them together into a full song.  They can also record
previously-written songs.

 * The band's COIN can be spent on any expense, but all band members must
   vote affirmatively to do so.
 * Any member can add their own COIN to buying an activity in Studio phase

To go into the studio, the band must spend COIN equal to 10×CLOUT. They must
reach this decision by consensus.
If consensus cannot be reached the band [breaks up](#breaking-up-the-band).

A single studio phase can be used to write one song or record one song. It
cannot be used for multiple.

### Write a song

The players will fill out a new song sheet taken from the supply.

The players take turns, in order of highest COMMITMENT.

On a turn, a player discards a card from their hand or they must "leave the
studio".  When a card is discarded, the squares and circles shown on the card
get drawn onto the song sheet.

The first thing added to a song sheet must be a song part.

After that, all squares and circles must be drawn onto the song sheet so that
they are "connected" to the existing song.

If a player leaves the studio, they cannot participate in the songwriting until
the beginning of the next Studio phase.

### Record a song

Record an existing original. Choose a song and play through it as you would
at a gig.

Do not take an individual score, but add your scores up the same way you
would for your gig score.

Add CLOUT×(# of recorded songs) to the score.

Round the score up to the nearest multiple of 10.

That sum is the "recorded score". Write that on the record symbol of the
song sheet.

## Drawing Gig Cards

### Drawing Gig Cards

At the beginning of the game, split the gig cards into "locked" and
"unlocked" decks.

Tastes and trends change in music, and the gigs that were available last
week might not be available this week.

 * Shuffle the "unlocked" deck.
 * Lay out four gig cards face-up
 * The player with the most CROWD will now choose one of the
   face-up gig cards
    * If the gig card has requirements the band must meet them
 * If the band cannot qualify for any of the four gigs,
   the band [breaks up](#breaking-up-the-band)

### Meeting Gig Requirements

If a gig requires a minimum number of CROWD, that is the minimum amount
of crowd **the band** must have.  If the band doesn't quite have enough
CROWD for a gig, band members can bring their friends to the show.

But there is a cost to bring friends out to a gig. You might need to
provide transportation or promise your friends some freebies to get them
to come out. But it won't cost as much if the band has started making a
name for itself.

If the gig card shows the :minibus: symbol, you can bring friends to the show.
You can bring a maximum number of friends equal to your personal CROWD.
For every friend you bring, you must spend COIN equal to the number shown
on the :minibus: symbol of the gig card.

**For example**, let's look at a gig that requires 20 CROWD and has a 3 next
to the :minibus: symbol.
In this example, the band only has 15 CROWD, Player 1 has 3 CROWD and 20 COIN,
and Player 2 has 5 CROWD and 10 COIN.

So the players need to cover the 5 CROWD difference between 20 and 15.

Player 1 spends 9 COIN (3× the amount shown on the :minibus: symbol). This brings 3
friends to the show (Player 1's maximum amount).

Now there is a 2 CROWD deficit between 20 and 18.

Player 2 spends 6 COIN (2× the amount shown on the :minibus: symbol).
This brings 2 of Player 2's friends to the show.

Now there are 20 people coming to the show, so the band qualifies to play
the gig.

**Note**, when you bring friends to a show, **do not modify** your CROWD
or the band's CROWD.



## Breaking up the band

A major label is interested in taking each one of you solo. But first you
have to prove to them that you can play well and attract an audience.

### Step 1 - Choose songs

Your level of commitment will determine who has rights to the original
songs the band has written.

In order of most COMMITMENT, choose one of the band's original songs, and
take it for yourself. If there are no original songs left, you will have
to play a cover (ie, just roll a single 6-sided die).

### Step 2 - Play your song

Just like when gigging, play the one song you have chosen. But only use
your character.
For the missing roles of your former bandmates, you will use "studio
musicians" - stand-ins who have no Craft nor Intensity powers.
Each player may do this in parallel.

### Step 3 - Build your fanbase

Add up your points from *all* the circles on the song you just played.
(Or, if you played a cover, just take the result of your roll)
Don't take any personal points.  Instead just take the total score for the
song and add it to your personal CROWD.

The player with the most CROWD goes solo and wins the game.


# Role-playing Variant

In this variant, there is a 4th player, the GM.  Gig cards are removed from
the game and instead, the GM presents the band with each gig scenario, and
declares what goals must be met to get stars or bomb the gig.

# Party Game Variant

In the party game variant, you do not use the Gig deck. The win condition
is instead playing 5 songs in a row where **all** the circles score.

Remove the circle cards from the Write and Riff deck. Then shuffle it, and
put it on the table face-down.  You do not use the Write and Riff market in
this game variant.

Every round, the band plays all of their original songs.

Once a song has started (the first dice are rolled):

 * The **Beats** player must not talk or make any vocal sounds,
   they can only air-drum and tap the table or game components
 * The **Melody** player must not talk or tap the table or components,
   they can only air-guitar and hum
 * The **Front** player has no communication restrictions, but they must
   be kept from seeing the available dice until it's their turn to place
   one (this can be done with hands or a screen)

After a song is played, add up your individual scores as usual, but you do
not need to add up a band score.  The CLOUT, COMMITMENT, COIN, and CROWD
stats are not used in the Party Game variant. Instead, every 5 points the
players earn let them either: take cards from the top of the Write and Riff
deck or Live the Life and go up a level.

Players can keep the cards hidden from their bandmates if they so choose.

After that, they can **Write a song** for free, as long as they have the
cards.

Then the next round begins.

# Silent Song Variant

 * Players cannot talk after the first dice roll in each song

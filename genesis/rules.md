# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! is a game for 3 players, so gather two other
friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

 * 16 6-sided dice (it's possible to play the game with 4 if you don't have 16)
 * 7 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the Write and Riff deck)
   * 3 Beats (4-sided) dice
   * 2 Melody (6-sided) dice
   * 2 Front (8-sided) dice
 * Band sheet
 * Song sheets
 * Character sheets
 * Deck of Gig cards
 * Deck of Write and Riff cards
 * Write and Riff / Live the Life tracking sheet
 * 3 Pencils
 * 3 different colored felt-tip pens (optional)

When you draw permanent marks that are role-related, it can be useful to
use a colored felt-tip pen, with each role assigned a specific color.

### Forming your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, holding the line of percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, pouring out a river of auditory colors. And one will play the **Front**
role, braving the spotlight and interacting with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role, then take a character sheet and fill in
some of the blanks:

 * write down your role on the character sheet
 * write down the name of your character
 * decide what specific musical instrument your character plays and write it down
 * write down your character's special bonus:
   * Beats:
     * Whenever the band gets ðŸ’£, immediately Live the Life at no cost
     * Whenever the band gets âœ°âœ° or higher at a gig, gain ____
   * Melody:
     * Whenever you Live the Life, take 10 of the band's COIN
   * Front:
     * Whenever the band gets âœ°, gain (âœ°Ã—(2+CLOUT)) COMMITMENT
 * Live the Life for a cost of 0 COMMITMENT and fill in one bubble in either
   your Intensity or your Craft track.

Take the Band sheet and give yourselves a band name.

Your band starts its career with one original song. Name the song and write
it down on the song sheet.

Your band's career is made up of a series of "gigs". In this game, you draw
gig cards, play a gig, do a downtime activity, go to the studio, then start
over again, until the game ends.


## Ending the game

There are 2 ways the game can end, either by staying together and becoming
musical legends, or by breaking up the band.

If you ever get âœ°âœ°âœ°âœ° from playing one gig, the band has become legendary
and you all have won the game together.  Congratulations!

Any time the band is *not* actively playing a gig, any member of the band can
declare that they are **breaking up the band**. Breaking up the band will
mean that only one player will be the winner.

### Breaking up the band

A major label is interested in taking each one of you solo. But first you
have to prove to them that you can play well and attract an audience.

#### Step 1 - Choose songs

Your level of commitment will determine who has rights to the original
songs the band has written.

In order of most COMMITMENT, choose one of the band's original songs, and
take it for yourself. If there are no original songs left, you will have
to play a cover (ie, just roll a single 6-sided die).

#### Step 2 - Play your song

Just like when gigging, play the one song you have chosen. But only use
your character.
For the two missing roles, you will use "studio musicians" - stand-ins who
have no Craft nor Intensity powers.
Each player may do this in parallel.

#### Step 3 - Build your fanbase

Add up your points from *all* the circles on the song you just played.
(Or, if you played a cover, just take the result of your roll)
Don't take any personal points.  Instead just take the total score for the
song and add it to your personal CROWD.

The player with the most CROWD goes solo and wins the game.


## Drawing Gig Cards

### First draw

At the beginning of the game, split the gig cards into "locked" and
"unlocked" decks.


## Playing a Gig


## Downtime Phase


## Studio Phase



# Role-playing Variant

In this variant, there is a 4th player, the GM.  Gig cards are removed from
the game and instead, the GM presents the band with each gig scenario, and
declares what goals must be met to get stars or bomb the gig.

# Party Game Variant

This variant plays the same as the regular game, except there are extra
conditions that must be met to get âœ°âœ°âœ° or âœ°âœ°âœ°âœ°:

Once a song has started (the first dice are rolled), only 

 * The **Beats** player must not talk or make any vocal sounds,
   they can only air-drum and tap the table or game components
 * The **Melody** player must not talk or tap the table or components,
   they can only air-guitar and hum
 * The **Front** player has no communication restrictions, but they must
   be kept from seeing the available dice until it's their turn to place
   one (this can be done with hands or a screen)

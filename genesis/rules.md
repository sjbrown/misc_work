Playtest version VERSION

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! is a game for 3 players, so gather two other
friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

`TODO: diagram`

 * 15 6-sided dice
 * 3 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the Write and Riff deck)
     - Boom die (faces: 2,2,4,4,4,4)
     - Stereo die (faces: 1,2,3,4,5,6)
     - Charm die (faces: 4,5,5,6,7,7)
 * 15 Meeples (meeples and markers can be coins or glass beads)
 * 15 Goal Circle Markers
 * 18 Player Markers (6 each for Beats, Melody and Front)
 * Deck of Gig cards
 * Deck of Write and Riff cards
 * Deck of Event cards
 * Game Board sheet
 * Band sheet
 * Song sheets
 * Character sheets
 * Score tracking sheet
 * Live the Life / Write and Riff sheet
 * 3 Pencils
 * 3 different colored felt-tip pens (optional)

When you draw permanent marks that are role-related, it can be useful to
use a colored felt-tip pen, with each role assigned a specific color.

**Each player gets:** A character sheet, a pencil, and two Event cards,
"Chill" and "Go Solo".

Place three Player Markers, Beats, Melody, and Front, at the top of the 
Game Board sheet in the spot marked Start.

Place three Player Markers, Beats, Melody, and Front, on the 0 spots of
the Score tracks.

Arrange the Gig cards in a face-up deck, with the unlocked Gigs at the top.

Shuffle the Event deck and place it face-down near the Live the Life track.

Shuffle the Write and Riff deck and place it face-down near the Write and Riff
market.  Deal out the first 4 Write and Riff cards face-up onto the market
spaces.



### Forming your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, holding steady the percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, pouring out a river of auditory colors. And one will play the **Front**
role, braving the top of the stage and interacting with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role, then take a character sheet and fill in
some of the blanks:

 * circle your role
 * write down the name of your character
 * decide what specific musical instrument your character plays and write it down
 * (optional) draw a portrait of your character

Take the Band sheet and give yourselves a band name.

Your band starts its career with one original song. Name the song and write
it down on the song sheet.

Finally, place a player marker for everyone on the first spot on the Live the
Life track, and everyone will fill in one bubble on either the Craft or
Intensity track on their character sheet. The choices are
"Re-roll" or "Bump It":

 * Re-roll is the first bubble in the Intensity track
 * Bump It is the first bubble in the Craft track

## The Goal

Your band's career is made up of a series of "Gigs". In this game, you draw
Gig cards, play a Gig, improve your skills, go to the studio, then start
over again, until, hopefully, you achieve legendary status by going on a
**World Tour** or headlining at the **Bonchellsquatch Music Festival**!

Every round you will:

 * Play a Gig
 * Get better at music (Write & Riff or Live the Life)
 * Hold a Band Meeting
 * Sometimes hire a Producer and enter the Studio
 * Use your band's Clout to unlock new Gig opportunities

**There are 2 ways to win the game**! You can win as a team, by sticking
together and *becoming musical legends*, or you can win by unleashing your
star power, and *going solo* to win all the glory for yourself.

If your band reaches the **World Tour** or **Bonchellsquatch Music Festival**
Gigs and achieves "✰✰✰✰" as the outcome, the band ascended to the halls
of musical superstardom and you all have won the game together.
Congratulations!

If instead, during the Band Meeting, any player plays the "Go Solo!"
card, then the band breaks up and players must try to win the game for
themselves by playing the [Breaking Up the Band](#breaking-up-the-band)
mini-game.

Any players that win the Breaking Up the Band mini-game get to use their
character sheets, with all the Intensity and Craft skills they've acquired,
in their next game of Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

If it comes time to play a Gig, but your band doesn't qualify for any
Gigs, then the game is over and your whole band dwindles into obscurity, their
songs becoming curiosities for a few well-researched DJs.

## Playing a Gig

When the game begins, you will play your first Gig, "Open Mic Night at Vishnu's".

Subsequent Gigs will be chosen from the unlocked Gig cards.

In the upper right corner of a Gig card, the requirements for playing are
indicated. These requirements are a number of "Crowd" the band must have, or
sometimes a cost to get access to the Gig.

The Gig "Open Mic Night at Vishnu's" has a blank upper right corner,
meaning there are no requirements.

Every Gig card has a symbol underneath its title that shows how many meeples
are in the music venue. Take the number on the center meeple icon and place
that many meeples next to the Stage.  Take the number on the left meeple icon,
holding a drink, and place that many meeples in the Bar area. Take the number
on the right meeple icon, holding a phone, and place that many meeples in
the Patio area.

For "Open Mic Night at Vishnu's", you will place 3 meeples in the Patio area.

Underneath the number of meeples, the number of songs you must play is written.

Your goal will be to move meeples from the lower areas up to the Stage area,
moving and grooving to the music. You definitely don't want them outside
on the Patio area, bored and thinking about their life choices.

The instruction "**move a meeple up**" means move a meeple from the
Bar area to the Stage area, or move a meeple from the Patio area to
the Bar area. If all meeples are in the Stage area, do nothing.

The instruction "**move a meeple down**" means move a meeple from the
Stage area to the Bar area, or move a meeple from the Bar area to
the Patio area. If all meeples are in the Patio area, do nothing.

Playing "covers", "originals", and "recorded originals" will give you chances
to move meeples up closer to the stage, but mistakes and bad luck could cause
them to move further away.

### Expert mode: The Lull

These meeples get thirsty. Some Gig cards indicate "The Lull": how many meeples
will move away from the Stage area between songs. These meeples move down
after every original song.  The only way to stop meeples from moving down
during a lull is to have a player "hog the spotlight"
(see Playing Originals below).

### Playing Covers

To get the crowd warmed up, you can play some cover songs.

Playing Covers must be done **before** playing any Originals.

Subtract the number of Original songs you have from the number of songs you
must play in this Gig, and gather that many dice.

Each die represents a cover song your band will play.  One player rolls
all these dice and checks to see if any of these succeeded by looking at the
number under "Covers" on the Gig card. For every die that "succeeds",
**move a meeple up**.

For fun, you can declare what cover song each die represents.

When you're done playing covers, you move on to playing Orignal songs.

You can play your original songs in any order, but if there's disagreement,
the player with the highest COMMITMENT gets to choose.


### Playing Originals

To play an Original, set the song sheet within reach of all the players.
On the song sheet are columns of squares. Each column is called a *Song Part*.

The bottom row is for the **Beats** player, the middle, for the **Melody**
player, and the top for the **Front** player.
Like bars of music, *Song Parts* are played in order, from left-to-right.

The player whose square is at the bottom of the *Song Part* starts it by
rolling dice. Usually, this will be the **Beats** player.

This player gathers dice, as many as the number of squares in the
column. *If this is the first Song Part of a song, they add one more die*.
(If the first *Song Part* has 3 squares, they will take 4 dice)
Then they roll them all and place them into the "Dice Pool" area.

That same player then gets to choose one die from the Dice Pool and
place it into their square in the *Song Part*. From bottom to top, the other
players take a turn choosing one die from the Dice Pool and putting
it into their square (scoring Goal Circles as they go) until all squares
in the column are full.

After a die is placed in a square, check if any Goal Circles that touch
that square *trigger* (see next section).

> Players aged 12 years and younger may remove a die and rethink their move
> after the die has touched their square. Otherwise, dice cannot be removed
> from a square until the song is finished.

#### Goal Circles

The starting four Goal Circles:

 * Equals ⊜
    - Trigger: there are dice on both sides
    - Success: the die on the left *equals* the die on the right
    - Score: the value of one of the adjacent dice
 * Up arrow ↗
    - Trigger: there are dice on both sides
    - Success: the die on the left is *less than* the die on the right
    - Score: the value of the *right* die minus the *left* die
 * Down arrow ↘
    - Trigger: there are dice on both sides
    - Success: the die on the left is *greater than* the die on the right
    - Score: the value of the *left* die minus the *right* die
 * Pose
    - Trigger: there is a die on the square
    - Success: the die is *greater than* **one** of the other dice in
      the column (or, this die is the **only** die in the column)
    - Score: the value of this die minus the *lowest in the column*
      (or the value of this die, if it is the **only** die in the column)

If placing a die in the square *triggers* a Goal Circle, and that Goal
Circle "succeeds", then that Goal Circle scores! It is marked successful,
and **a meeple moves up**.

If a Goal Circle gets triggered, but it does not succeed, **a meeple moves
down**.

When you score, move your Player Marker around the Stage. Step your marker
into the numbered circles, taking one step for every point scored. Once your
marker "*sets foot*" in the spotlight, take a "10 Chip" and continue forward.

Just as two musicians can't be in the same spot on the stage, Player Markers
can't ever be in the same spot either, so, if there's a Player Marker occupying
the next spot, just skip over them.

> For example, if your Player Marker was in the "Start" spot, and another
> player's was in the "3" spot, and you scored 3 points, your marker would
> end up on the "4" spot.

If your Player Marker is in the spotlight at the end of your turn, you are
**hogging the spotlight**.  This has two effects.  Firstly, when other player
markers are stepping around the stage, they will have to skip the spotlight,
and they won't collect a "10 chip".  Secondly, because your character is
hamming it up, meeples will not move down when the rules say they
normally would (this includes failed Goal Circles and "The Lull").

#### Marking a circle

After a Goal Circle is triggered and scored, take a Goal Circle Marker
and place it on the circle. If the goal was successful, place it
positive-side-up and remember to **move a meeple up**.

If a Goal Circle was unsuccessful, place the marker negative-side-up and
remember to **move a meeple down**.

Note, the **Overdub** power makes it possible to place two dice on one square.
Wait until both dice have scored, then place the marker.
The circle should be marked unsuccessful if *either* die fails the
success criteria.

#### Finishing the song

For every *Song Part* in the song, this process is repeated: the starting
player gathers dice, rolls them, adds them to the Dice Pool, then each
player with a square in the column chooses and places a die.

After a *Song Part* is complete, there will usually be one unchosen die.
That die stays in the Dice Pool. When the *song* is over, the Dice Pool
is cleared.

You cannot play an original more than once per Gig.

#### Technical difficulties

**If there are no dice left in the Dice Pool** for a player to place in
their square, and they do not have any special dice to add to the Dice
Pool, then the song immediately ends, and any unmarked Goal Circles
remaining are marked failed.

### Using Craft or Intensity powers

As you play an original song, you can use the special powers on your
character sheet to make things easier or give yourself a boost.

Unless otherwise specified, Craft or Intensity powers must be used:

 * On your turn
 * Before you place a die into a square

Each one of these powers can be used **once per Gig**. After using a power,
place a marker over that power on your character sheet.

#### Intensity

 1. Re-roll - Re-roll **all** the dice in the Dice Pool
 2. Over-dub - take two dice instead of one from the Dice Pool and put
    them both in your square.
 3. Rush the Mic - Move your Player Marker forward on the track to the
    spotlight, bumping any other player markers along the way directly
    to the Start position on the stage.
 4. Rock out - Re-roll only **some** of the dice in the Dice Pool. Roll all
    Dice whose values equal those shown by the secondary bubble.

#### Craft

 1. Bump It - Change the value of one die in the Dice Pool up or down
    by 1. Eg, change a 4 to a 5 or 3. (You cannot change a 1 to a 6 or vice versa)
 2. Echo - Change the value of one die in the Dice Pool to be the
    value of a die that was just placed in a square by the previous player
 3. Inspiration - whenever you buy a Write and Riff card,
    also take 1 card from the top of the Write and Riff deck. If it's a card
    you can't use, put it on the bottom of the deck.
 4. Diva die - Take a die from the Dice Pool whose value equals one shown in
    the secondary bubble and put it beside your character sheet. Place it back
    into the Dice Pool any time during the Gig


### Playing Recorded Originals

After a few Gigs and visits to the Studio, you may have had a chance to
record a song or two. (see Studio phase below)

Since the band has had a lot of practice playing those recorded songs,
and the hook is familiar to the audience, you can get consistent results.

If you choose to play a Recorded Original, look to your song sheet where you
wrote down the Studio results. Just move the number of meeples indicated up,
then in order from top-to-bottom, move each player's marker around the stage
the amount indicated, collecting "10 chips" just as you would when playing an
Original.

You cannot play an original more than once per Gig, whether it is recorded
or not.


### Succeeding or Failing Gigs

Every Gig card has a chart that tells you 3 possible outcomes

 1. All the meeples are next to the stage
 2. More meeples are next to the stage than the Bar and Patio
 3. Equal or fewer meeples are next to the stage than the Bar and Patio

Next to each symbol are how many points *the Band* will gain or lose.
Tally the indicated points on your Band Sheet.


### Distributing your individual score points

There are 3 kinds of points an individual can gain.
Points in COIN and COMMITMENT can be spent during the Downtime and Studio
phases. CROWD points can be used to qualify for new Gigs and are critical
for anyone planning to Go Solo.

At the end of a Gig, players add up all their 10 Chips, then add one
point for each of their successful goal circle markers.

They can distribute those points into their CROWD, COMMITMENT, and COIN,
depending on their Role. (See the character sheet)
Each Role may only distribute individual points into **two**
categories, as shown on the character sheet. For example, the Front player
may only put their individual score points into COIN or CROWD.

To keep score, move your Player Score Marker along the relevant track.

Players don't have to show how you are splitting up points until
everyone declares that they've finished.

### Distributing your spotlight score points

If a Player Marker is in the spotlight *at the end of the Gig*, then
that player gets bonus **spotlight points**.

That player gets points equal to *the number of meeples next to the stage*.
Those points may be distributed into COIN, COMMITMENT, or CROWD, no matter
what Role the player plays.

## Downtime Phase

Every band member chooses how they want to devote their down-time between
Gigs. They must choose **either** Live the Life, or Write and Riff. They
cannot do both in one round. (They may also choose to skip)

 * Players take turns in order of highest COMMITMENT
 * The band's COIN can be spent on any expense, by any band member, at any time

### Live the Life

When a musician hangs out with their buddies, and trades tricks with their
peers, they gain new skills to apply to their performances.

Players can spend COMMITMENT to go up levels in either Intensity or
Craft. When you go up a level, fill in an Intensity or Craft bubble on your
character sheet. A bubble is only allowed to be filled in if all the
bubbles to its left are filled in.

The first level (which costs 0) should have been taken when the game began.

A player can move up the track multiple spaces if they have enough
COMMITMENT to spend.

The COMMITMENT cost to fill in a new bubble is printed next to the spaces
on the track. You can play on "Normal" or "Expert" mode to adjust the
difficulty.

After you spend COMMITMENT and fill in bubbles, take one Event card.
Event cards are used during the Band Meeting phase.

Event cards must be kept secret from the other players. Neither the title,
nor effects may be disclosed.

When the Event deck is empty, the discards are shuffled into a new Event deck

### Write and Riff

When a musician devotes their downtime to coming up with new song ideas
and trying out new techniques in the practice room, they emerge ready to
collaborate on writing new songs.

When a player chooses Write and Riff for their downtime phase, they can take
these actions as many times as they want:

 * Buy a face-up card with COIN
 * Spend 2 COMMITMENT to discard the $5 card
 * Spend 6 COMMITMENT to discard all the face-up cards

Any time a hole opens up from discarding or buying a face-up card,
move left any cards on the right of the hole, then place the top card of
the deck face-up in the open slot.

If a card indicates a certain role (Beats, Melody, or Front), only a player
with that role can buy the card.

If the player buys a Die Card, they immediately take that die from the supply.
If this removes the *last* of that kind of die from the supply, the Die Card
is put back in the box, otherwise, it is put into the discard pile.

A player must show the other players what card they gain as they take it, but
afterward, can choose whether to let the other players see the cards they've
accumulated.


## Band Meeting Phase

Players will start with two event cards, a "Chill" card, and a "Go Solo" card.
During Live the Life, gain additional Event cards.

Players look at their Event cards, and secretly choose one.
They place that chosen card face-down on the table in front of them.
When all players have chosen, the cards are revealed simultaneously.
Then the effects (if any) are executed.

Players may discuss a plan before choosing an Event card, but
can not disclose the title or effects of any gained Event cards.

If a "Chill" card is played, it has no effect, *unless all three
players played a "Chill" card*, in which case an unlocked Gig card is randomly
chosen and "burnt" (that is, placed back into the box).

If a "Producer" card is played, place it next to the Studio. Now there are
multiple producers to hire during the Studio phase. After the Studio phase
ends, discard the "Producer" card.

If a "Go Solo" card is played, the band breaks up. Execute any other played
Event cards first, then transition to the Breaking Up The Band mini-game.
(see below)

Other Event cards are discarded after they are executed. If there is a
conflict, cards are executed in order of COMMITMENT.


## Studio Phase

In the studio, bands can gather all the *Song Parts* that they've individually
created and patch them together into a full song.  They can also record
previously-written songs.

 * The band's COIN can be spent on any expense, by any player, at any time.
 * Any member can add their own COIN to buying an activity in Studio phase

To go into the studio, the band must first hire at least one Producer and spend
the associated COIN.

A single studio phase can be used to write and record multiple songs. For
each action, the Producer must be paid the indicated COIN fee.

If multiple producers are hired, only one producer may work on a given song.

The Studio Phase may be skipped.

### Write a song

The players will fill out a new song sheet taken from the supply.
A song sheet must have at least 3 *Song Parts* and no more than 5 *Song Parts*.

The players take turns, in order of highest COMMITMENT.

On a turn, a player plays either a *Song Part* card or a Circle card.
That player copies the squares and circles shown on the card into
the song sheet, then discards the card.

The first thing added to a song sheet must be a *Song Part*.

When playing a *Song Part Card*, the squares and circles must be drawn into
an empty column on the song sheet, adjacent to an already-drawn *Song Part*.
(If this is the first *Song Part* on the sheet, it may be drawn in any column)

When the 4th or 5th columns get drawn into, an extra circle must also be
drawn onto the song.  The *Song Part* Card will indicate what kind of circle.

When playing a Circle Card, the drawing must be made into an unoccupied
circle at a position indicated on the card.

### Record a song

To record a song, pay the recording fee, then, take the meeple movement and
Player Marker movement numbers shown on the Producer card and copy them to
the Song Sheet, writing them into the area above the "Vinyl Disc" recording
symbol.

## Gig Cards

### Drawing Gig Cards

Tastes and trends change in music, and the Gigs that were available last
week might not be available this week.

 * The player with the most CROWD chooses one of the unlocked Gig cards
    * If the Gig card has requirements the band must meet them
 * If the band cannot qualify for any of the four Gigs, the band loses the game

### Meeting Gig Requirements

If a Gig requires a minimum number of CROWD, that is the minimum amount
of crowd **the band** must have.

If the band doesn't quite have enough CROWD for a Gig, band members can bring
their friends to the show.  Band members can voluntarily decrease their
CROWD score and increase the band's CROWD score that same amount.


## Breaking up the band

A major label is interested in taking each you solo. But first you
have to prove to them that you can play well and attract an audience.

If only one player flipped a Go Solo card, split into **2 teams**, with
the other two players playing on the same team. If two players are playing
as a team, they first combine their current CROWD scores into one *combined*
CROWD score.

If two or three players flipped a Go Solo card, then it's **everyone for
themselves**.

### Step 1 - Choose songs

Your level of commitment will determine who has rights to the original
songs the band has written.

**In order of most COMMITMENT**, choose one of the band's original songs, and
take it for yourself. If there are no original songs left, you will have
to play a cover (ie, just roll a single 6-sided die, with 5 or 6 counting
as a success, and anything else counting as a failure).

### Step 2 - Play your song

Just like when gigging, play the one song you have chosen. But for the
missing roles of your former bandmates, you will use "**studio
musicians**" - stand-ins under your direction who have no Craft nor Intensity
powers.

### Step 3 - Build your fanbase

When your song is over, every successful circle and every "10 chip" counts
as a point.  Add the points to your CROWD score.

**Every mistake subtracts 5 from your CROWD score.**

The player(s) with the most CROWD successfully goes solo and wins the game.
Only they may take their character sheet and use that character in the
next game of Genesis of Destiny Supreme!


## Ties

If there is ever a tie, it is broken in this order: Beats, Melody, then Front.


# Role-playing Variant

In this variant, there is an additional player, the GM.  Gig cards are removed
from the game and instead, the GM presents the band with each gig scenario,
and declares what goals must be met to pass or fail the gig.

<!--
# Party Game Variant

In the party game variant, you do not use the Gig deck. The win condition
is instead playing 5 songs in a row where **all** the circles score.

Remove the circle cards from the Write and Riff deck. Then shuffle it, and
put it on the table face-down.  You do not use the Write and Riff market in
this game variant.

Every round, the band plays all of their original songs.

Once a song has started (the first dice are rolled):

 * The **Beats** player must not talk or make any vocal sounds,
   they can only air-drum and tap the table or game components
 * The **Melody** player must not talk or tap the table or components,
   they can only air-guitar and hum
 * The **Front** player has no communication restrictions, but they must
   be kept from seeing the available dice until it's their turn to place
   one (this can be done with hands or a screen)

After a song is played, add up your individual scores as usual, but you do
not need to add up a band score.  The CLOUT, COMMITMENT, COIN, and CROWD
stats are not used in the Party Game variant. Instead, every 5 points the
players earn let them either: take cards from the top of the Write and Riff
deck or Live the Life and go up a level.

Players can keep the cards hidden from their bandmates if they so choose.

After that, they can **Write a song** for free, as long as they have the
cards.

Then the next round begins.

# Silent Song Variant

 * Players cannot talk after the first dice roll in each song

-->

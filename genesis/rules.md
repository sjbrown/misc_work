# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! is a game for 3 players, so gather two other
friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

 * 15 6-sided dice (it's possible to play the game with 4 if you don't have 15)
 * 7 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the Write and Riff deck)
   * 3 Beats (4-sided) dice
   * 2 Melody (6-sided) dice
   * 2 Front (8-sided) dice
 * Band sheet
 * Song sheets
 * Character sheets
 * Live the Life / Write and Riff sheet
 * Deck of Gig cards
 * Deck of Write and Riff cards
 * Write and Riff / Live the Life tracking sheet
 * 3 Pencils
 * 3 different colored felt-tip pens (optional)

When you draw permanent marks that are role-related, it can be useful to
use a colored felt-tip pen, with each role assigned a specific color.

### Forming your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, holding the line of percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, pouring out a river of auditory colors. And one will play the **Front**
role, braving the spotlight and interacting with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role, then take a character sheet and fill in
some of the blanks:

 * write down your role on the character sheet
 * write down the name of your character
 * decide what specific musical instrument your character plays and write it down
 * write down your character's special bonus:
   * Beats:
     * Whenever the band bombs (:bomb:), immediately Live the Life at no cost
     * Whenever the band gets ✰✰ or higher at a gig, gain 3 CROWD per ✰
   * Melody:
     * Whenever you Live the Life, take 10 of the band's COIN
   * Front:
     * Whenever the band gets ✰, gain (2+CLOUT) COMMITMENT per ✰
 * Live the Life for a cost of 0 COMMITMENT and fill in one bubble in either
   your Intensity or your Craft track. Put a marker for your character on
   the first box of the Live the Life track.

Take the Band sheet and give yourselves a band name.

Your band starts its career with one original song. Name the song and write
it down on the song sheet.

Your band's career is made up of a series of "gigs". In this game, you draw
gig cards, play a gig, do a downtime activity, go to the studio, then start
over again, until the game ends.


## Winning the game

There are 2 ways the game can end, either by staying together and becoming
musical legends, or by breaking up the band.

If you ever get ✰✰✰✰ from playing one gig, the band has become legendary
and you all have won the game together.  Congratulations!

Any time the band is *not* actively playing a gig, any member of the band can
declare that they are
[breaking up the band](#breaking-up-the-band).
Breaking up the band will mean that only one player will be the winner.


## Drawing Gig Cards

### First draw

At the beginning of the game, split the gig cards into "locked" and
"unlocked" decks.

Tastes and trends change in music, and the gigs that were available last
week might not be available this week.

 * Shuffle the "unlocked" deck.
 * **Except during the very first round**, burn one of the "unlocked" gig
   cards - remove it from the game.
 * Lay out four gig cards face-up
 * The player with the most CROWD will now choose one of the
   face-up gig cards
    * If the gig card has requirements the band must meet them
 * If the band cannot qualify for any of the four gigs,
   the band [breaks up](#breaking-up-the-band)

### Meeting Gig Requirements

If a gig requires a minimum number of CROWD, that is the minimum amount
of crowd **the band** must have.  If the band doesn't quite have enough
CROWD for a gig, band members can bring their friends to the show.

But there is a cost to bring friends out to a gig. You might need to
provide transportation or promise your friends some freebies to get them
to come out. But it won't cost as much if the band has started making a
name for itself.

If the gig card shows the :minibus: symbol, you can bring friends to the show.
You can bring a maximum number of friends equal to your personal CROWD.
For every friend you bring, you must spend COIN equal to the number shown
on the :minibus: symbol of the gig card.

**For example**, let's look at a gig that requires 20 CROWD and has a 3 next
to the :minibus: symbol.
In this example, the band only has 15 CROWD, Player 1 has 3 CROWD and 20 COIN,
and Player 2 has 5 CROWD and 10 COIN.

So the players need to cover the 5 CROWD difference between 20 and 15.

Player 1 spends 9 COIN (3× the amount shown on the :minibus: symbol). This brings 3
friends to the show (Player 1's maximum amount).

Now there is a 2 CROWD defecit between 20 and 18.

Player 2 spends 6 COIN (2× the amount shown on the :minibus: symbol).
This brings 2 of Player 2's friends to the show.

Now there are 20 people coming to the show, so the band qualifies to play
the gig.

**Note**, when you bring friends to a show, **do not modify** your CROWD
or the band's CROWD.


## Playing a Gig

Every gig card has a chart that tells you what gig score you need to get
to get ✰ (or whether you bomb).

Build up your gig score by playing "covers", "originals", and "recorded
originals".

### Playing "covers"

Most gigs allow you to play covers.  To play a cover, just roll a
six-sided die, and add that number to your gig score.

### Playing recorded originals

Just add the recorded score to your gig score.

You cannot play an original more than once per gig, whether it is recorded
or not.

### Playing originals

You cannot play an original more than once per gig.

Set the song sheet in the middle of the table. On the song sheet are columns
of squares. Each column is called a "song part".

The bottom row is for the **Beats** player, the middle, for the **Melody**
player, and the top for the **Front** player.
The song parts get played in order, left-to-right.

The **Beats** player usually starts each song part, but, for bridges
and solos, the song part is started by the player with the lowest open square
in that column.

This player gathers six-sided dice, equal to the number of squares in the
column. If this is the first song part of a song, they add one more die.
Then they roll them all. These are called the "available pool" of dice.

That same player then gets to choose one die out of the available pool and
place it into their square in the column. From bottom to top, the other
players take a turn choosing one die out of the available pool and putting
it into their square until all squares in the column are full.

Usually, there will be one unchosen die. That die stays in the available pool.

For every song part in the song, this process is repeated: the starting
player takes 1-3 dice, rolls them into the available pool, then each player
with a square in the column chooses and places a die.

### Using Craft or Intensity powers

TODO 

#### Intensity

 1. Reroll - use this power on your turn. You must reroll all the dice in the
    available pool
 2. Double-up - when you are picking your die from the available pool, take
    two dice instead of one and put them both in your square.
 3. Sustain - at the moment your turn would normally be skipped because the
    song part doesn't have an open square for you, place your sustain marker
    where your square would normally be, and take a turn

#### Craft

 1. Bump - Use this power on your turn. Change the value of one die in the
    available pool up or down by 1. Eg, change a 4 to a 5 or 3. (You
    cannot change a 1 to a 6 or vice versa)
 2. Clone - Use this power on your turn. Change the value of one die in the
    available pool to be the value of a die that was just placed in a square
    by the previous player
 3. Extra cards - if you buy a Write and Riff card during the Downtime phase,
    also take 2 cards from the top of the deck when the Downtime phase ends

### Counting points from an original song

The circles on the song sheet are what score points for players.

The band starts with one original song with the following circles:

 * Equals - This scores points for the **Beats** player. If the two dice
   adjacent to the circle are equal, add the points from each die. The
   **Beats** player scores that amount.
 * Up arrow - This scores points for the **Melody** player. Subtract the
   *right* die from the *left* die. The **Melody** player scores that amount.
 * Down arrow - This scores points for the **Melody** player. Subtract the
   *left* die from the *right* die. The **Melody** player scores that amount.
 * Crown - This scores points for the **Front** player. Subtract the Front
   die from the lowest of the other dice in the column. The **Front** player
   scores that amount.

Write down each players individual score. Then add each player's score
to the gig score.

### Distributing your gig score points

Every gig card has a chart that tells you what gig score you need to get
to get ✰ (or whether you bomb).

When the chart shows CROWD, COIN, or CLOUT points, add those to the respective
boxes on your band sheet.

If you gain CLOUT, you might unlock new Gig cards - add them to the
"unlocked" Gig deck.

### Distributing your individual score points

At the end of a gig, if the members got individual scores, they can split those
points into their CROWD, COMMITMENT, and COIN boxes on their character sheets.

However, each player may only distribute points into boxes that have the (GIG)
text inside them. For example, the Front player may only put their individual
score points into their COIN or CROWD boxes.

You don't have to show how you are splitting up your points until everyone
declares that they've finished.

Points in COIN and COMMITMENT can be spent during the Downtime and Studio
phases. CROWD points can be used to qualify for new gigs.


## Downtime Phase

Every band member chooses how they want to devote their down-time between
gigs. They must choose to either Live the Life, or Write and Riff. They
cannot do both in one round. (They may also choose to skip)

 * Players take turns in order of highest CROWD

 * The band's COIN can be spent on any expense, but all band members must
   vote affirmatively to do so.

### Live the Life

When a musician hangs out with their buddies, and trades tricks with their
peers, they gain new skills to apply to their performances.

Players can spend COMMITMENT to go up levels in either Intensity or
Craft. When you go up a level, fill in an Intensity or Craft bubble on your
character sheet. A bubble is only allowed to be filled in if all the
bubbles to its left are filled in.

The first level (which costs 0) should have been taken when the game
began.

When you go up a level, move your character's marker up to the next box
on the Live the Life track.

A player can move up the track multiple spaces if they have enough
COMMITMENT to spend.

The COMMITMENT cost to fill in a new bubble is printed next to the spaces
on the track. You can play on "Normal" or "Expert" mode to adjust the
difficulty.

### Write and Riff

When a musician devotes their downtime to coming up with new song ideas
and trying out new techniques in the practice room, they emerge ready to
collaborate on writing new songs.

At the beginning of the game, shuffle the Write and Riff deck, then place
it face-down to the right of the Write and Riff sheet. Take four cards
from the top of the deck and place them face-up in the $5, $15, $25, and $35
slots.

Discards should be placed face-up to the left of the Write and Riff sheet.

When a player chooses Write and Riff for their downtime phase, they can take
these actions as many times as they want:

 * Buy a face-up card with COIN
 * Spend 2 COMMITMENT to discard the $5 card
 * Spend 6 COMMITMENT to discard all the face-up cards

Any time a hole opens up from discarding or buying a face-up card,
move left any cards on the right of the hole, then place the top card of
the deck face-up in the open slot.

If a card indicates a certain role (Beats, Melody, or Front), only a player
with that role can buy the card.

If the player buys a DIE card, they immediately take that die from the supply
and put the card into the discard pile. Otherwise the player takes the card
into their "hand". A player can choose whether to let the other players see
their hand.


## Studio Phase

In the studio, bands can gather all the song parts that they've individually
created and patch them together into a full song.  They can also record
previously-written songs.

 * The band's COIN can be spent on any expense, but all band members must
   vote affirmatively to do so.
 * Any member can add their own COIN to buying an activity in Studio phase

To go into the studio, the band must spend COIN equal to 10×CLOUT. They must
reach this decision by consensus.
If consensus cannot be reached the band [breaks up](#breaking-up-the-band).

A single studio phase can be used to write one song or record one song. It
cannot be used for multiple.

### Write a song

The players will fill out a new song sheet taken from the supply.

The players take turns, in order of highest COMMITMENT.

On a turn, a player discards a card from their hand or they must "leave the
studio".  When a card is discarded, the squares and circles shown on the card
get drawn onto the song sheet.

The first thing added to a song sheet must be a song part.

After that, all squares and circles must be drawn onto the song sheet so that
they are "connected" to the existing song.

If a player leaves the studio, they cannot participate in the songwriting unti
the beginning of the next Studio phase.

### Record a song

Record an existing original. Choose a song and play through it as you would
at a gig.

Do not take an individual score, but add your scores up the same way you
would for your gig score.

Add CLOUT×(# of recorded songs) to the score.

Round the score up to the nearest multiple of 10.

That sum is the "recorded score". Write that on the record symbol of the
song sheet.


## Breaking up the band

A major label is interested in taking each one of you solo. But first you
have to prove to them that you can play well and attract an audience.

### Step 1 - Choose songs

Your level of commitment will determine who has rights to the original
songs the band has written.

In order of most COMMITMENT, choose one of the band's original songs, and
take it for yourself. If there are no original songs left, you will have
to play a cover (ie, just roll a single 6-sided die).

### Step 2 - Play your song

Just like when gigging, play the one song you have chosen. But only use
your character.
For the missing roles of your former bandmates, you will use "studio
musicians" - stand-ins who have no Craft nor Intensity powers.
Each player may do this in parallel.

### Step 3 - Build your fanbase

Add up your points from *all* the circles on the song you just played.
(Or, if you played a cover, just take the result of your roll)
Don't take any personal points.  Instead just take the total score for the
song and add it to your personal CROWD.

The player with the most CROWD goes solo and wins the game.


# Role-playing Variant

In this variant, there is a 4th player, the GM.  Gig cards are removed from
the game and instead, the GM presents the band with each gig scenario, and
declares what goals must be met to get stars or bomb the gig.

# Party Game Variant

In the party game variant, you do not use the Gig deck. The win condition
is instead playing 5 songs in a row where **all** the circles score.

Remove the circle cards from the Write and Riff deck. Then shuffle it, and
put it on the table face-down.  You do not use the Write and Riff market in
this game variant.

Every round, the band plays all of their original songs.

Once a song has started (the first dice are rolled):

 * The **Beats** player must not talk or make any vocal sounds,
   they can only air-drum and tap the table or game components
 * The **Melody** player must not talk or tap the table or components,
   they can only air-guitar and hum
 * The **Front** player has no communication restrictions, but they must
   be kept from seeing the available dice until it's their turn to place
   one (this can be done with hands or a screen)

After a song is played, add up your individual scores as usual, but you do
not need to add up a band score.  The CLOUT, COMMITMENT, COIN, and CROWD
stats are not used in the Party Game variant. Instead, every 5 points the
players earn let them either: take cards from the top of the Write and Riff
deck or Live the Life and go up a level.

Players can keep the cards hidden from their bandmates if they so choose.

After that, they can **Write a song** for free, as long as they have the
cards.

Then the next round begins.

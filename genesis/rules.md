# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! is a game for 3 players, so gather two other
friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

 * 16 6-sided dice
 * 7 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the Write and Riff deck)
   * 3 Beats (4-sided) dice
   * 2 Melody (6-sided) dice
   * 2 Front (8-sided) dice
 * Band sheet
 * Song sheets
 * Character sheets (
 * Gig deck
 * Write and Riff deck
 * Write and Riff / Live the Life tracking sheet
 * 3 Pencils
 * 3 different colored felt-tip pens (optional)

When you draw permanent marks that are role-related, it can be useful to
use a colored felt-tip pen, with each role assigned a specific color.


### Creating your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, responsible for percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, responsible for the melody. One will play the **Front** role, and often
stands in the spotlight and interacts with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role, then take a character sheet and fill in
some of the blanks:

 * write down your role on the character sheet
 * write down the name of your character
 * decide what specific musical instrument your character plays and write it down
 * write down your character's special bonus:
   * Beats:
     * Whenever the band gets ðŸ’£, immediately Live the Life at no cost
     * Whenever the band gets âœ°âœ° or higher at a gig, gain ____
   * Melody:
     * Whenever you Live the Life, take 10 of the band's COIN
   * Front:
     * Whenever the band gets âœ°, gain (âœ°Ã—(2+CLOUT)) COMMITMENT
 * Live the Life for a cost of 0 COMMITMENT and fill in one bubble in either
   your Intensity or your Craft track.

Take the Band sheet and give yourselves a band name.

Your band starts its career with one original song. Name the song and write
it down on the song sheet.

Your band's career is made up of a series of "gigs". In this game, you play
a gig, do a downtime activity, go to the studio, then draw new gig cards, and

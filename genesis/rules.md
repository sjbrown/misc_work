# Genesis of Destiny Supreme!

## How to playtest

First of all, thank you for contributing to the development of this game!

To cross the finish line, the designer of this game needs some data from
brave and generous playtesters like yourself.

When you get to the end of your play session, **whether you finish the game
or not**, please gather some data and send it back so that it can be examined
and learned from.

Just take photos of all the game stuff on the table and email it to
sjb@ezide.com or if you want, tweet the photo to @boardcrafting on Twitter.
Try to make sure all the writing on the paper is readable in your photos.

Thanks again!


## Set up

Genesis of Destiny Supreme! is a game for 3 players, so gather two other
friends together at a table with the following components.

### Components

 * 16 6-sided dice (it's possible to play the game with 4 if you don't have 16)
 * 7 special dice (if you don't have these, you can still play. Just remove the dice cards from the Write and Riff deck)
   * 3 Beats (4-sided) dice
   * 2 Melody (6-sided) dice
   * 2 Front (8-sided) dice
 * Band sheet
 * Song sheets
 * Character sheets
 * Deck of Gig cards
 * Deck of Write and Riff cards
 * Write and Riff / Live the Life tracking sheet
 * 3 Pencils
 * 3 different colored felt-tip pens (optional)

When you draw permanent marks that are role-related, it can be useful to
use a colored felt-tip pen, with each role assigned a specific color.

### Forming your band

You are going to be playing as three members of a band, and each of you will
have a distinct musical responsibility. One player will play the **Beats**
role, holding the line of percussion and rhythm. One will play the **Melody**
role, pouring out a river of auditory colors. And one will play the **Front**
role, braving the spotlight and interacting with the live audience.

Decide who will play each role, then take a character sheet and fill in
some of the blanks:

 * write down your role on the character sheet
 * write down the name of your character
 * decide what specific musical instrument your character plays and write it down
 * write down your character's special bonus:
   * Beats:
     * Whenever the band gets ðŸ’£, immediately Live the Life at no cost
     * Whenever the band gets âœ°âœ° or higher at a gig, gain ____
   * Melody:
     * Whenever you Live the Life, take 10 of the band's COIN
   * Front:
     * Whenever the band gets âœ°, gain (âœ°Ã—(2+CLOUT)) COMMITMENT
 * Live the Life for a cost of 0 COMMITMENT and fill in one bubble in either
   your Intensity or your Craft track.

Take the Band sheet and give yourselves a band name.

Your band starts its career with one original song. Name the song and write
it down on the song sheet.

Your band's career is made up of a series of "gigs". In this game, you draw
gig cards, play a gig, do a downtime activity, go to the studio, then start
over again, until the game ends.


## Ending the game

There are 2 ways the game can end, either by staying together and becoming
musical legends, or by breaking up the band.

If you ever get âœ°âœ°âœ°âœ° from playing one gig, the band has become legendary
and you all have won the game together.  Congratulations!

Any time the band is *not* actively playing a gig, any member of the band can
declare that they are **breaking up the band**. Breaking up the band will
mean that only one player will be the winner.

### Breaking up the band

A major label is interested in taking each one of you solo. But first you
have to prove to them that you can play well and attract an audience.

#### Step 1 - Choose songs

Your level of commitment will determine who has rights to the original
songs the band has written.

In order of most COMMITMENT, choose one of the band's original songs, and
take it for yourself. If there are no original songs left, you will have
to play a cover (ie, just roll a single 6-sided die).

#### Step 2 - Play your song

Just like when gigging, play the one song you have chosen. But only use
your character.
For the missing roles of your former bandmates, you will use "studio
musicians" - stand-ins who have no Craft nor Intensity powers.
Each player may do this in parallel.

#### Step 3 - Build your fanbase

Add up your points from *all* the circles on the song you just played.
(Or, if you played a cover, just take the result of your roll)
Don't take any personal points.  Instead just take the total score for the
song and add it to your personal CROWD.

The player with the most CROWD goes solo and wins the game.


## Drawing Gig Cards

### First draw

At the beginning of the game, split the gig cards into "locked" and
"unlocked" decks.

Tastes and trends change in music, and the gigs that were available last
week might not be available this week.

 * Shuffle the "unlocked" deck.
 * Burn one of the "unlocked" gig cards - remove it from the game.
   * **Special rule**: only at the beginning of the game, you **do not**
     burn one of the Gig cards.
 * Lay out four gig cards face-up
 * The band will now choose one of the face-up Gig cards by consensus
   * If the gig card has requirements the band must meet them
 * If consensus cannot be reached, the band breaks up

### Meeting Gig Requirements

If a gig requires a minimum number of CROWD, that is the minimum amount
of crowd **the band** must have.  If the band doesn't quite have enough
CROWD for a gig, band members can bring their friends to the show.

But there is a cost to bring friends out to a gig. You might need to
provide transportation or promise your friends some freebies to get them
to come out. But it won't cost as much if the band has started making a
name for itself.

For every amount of COIN you spend shown on the â›Ÿ symbol of the gig card,
CLOUT of your friends will come see the show, up to the maximum of your
personal CROWD.

For example, let's take a gig that requires 20 CROWD, and the band only
has 15 CROWD.  The band, which has 2 CLOUT, wants to play this gig, which
has a â›Ÿ symbol showing 3. Player 1 has 5 CROWD and Player 2 has 3 CROWD.

So the players need to cover the 5 CROWD difference between 20 and 15.

Player 1 spends 3 COIN, the amount shown on the â›Ÿ symbol. Since the band
has 2 CLOUT, this brings 2 of Player 1's friends to the show.

Now there is a 3 CROWD difference between 20 and 15.

Player 2 spends 6 COIN, 2Ã— amount shown on the â›Ÿ symbol. Since the band
has 2 CLOUT, this could bring 4 of Player 2's friends to the show, but
since they only have 3 CROWD, it only brings the maximum, 3 friends.

Now there 20 people coming to the show, so the band qualifies to play
the gig.

**Note**, when you bring friends to a show, **do not modify** your CROWD
or the band's CROWD.


## Playing a Gig

Every gig card has a chart that tells you what gig score you need to get
to get âœ° (or whether you bomb).

Build up your gig score by playing "covers", "originals", and "recorded
originals".

### Playing "covers"

Most gigs allow you to play covers.  To play a cover, just roll a
six-sided die, and add that number to your gig score.

### Playing recorded originals

Just add the recorded score to your gig score.

You cannot play an original more than once per gig, whether it is recorded
or not.

### Playing originals

You cannot play an original more than once per gig.

Set the song sheet in the middle of the table. On the song sheet are columns
of squares. Each column is called a "song part".

The bottom row is for the **Beats** player, the middle, for the **Melody**
player, and the top for the **Front** player.
The song parts get played in order, left-to-right.

The **Beats** player usually starts each song part, but, for bridges
and solos, the song part is started by the player with the lowest open square
in that column.

This player gathers six-sided dice, equal to the number of squares in the
column. If this is the first song part of a song, they add one more die.
Then they roll them all. These are called the "available pool" of dice.

That same player then gets to choose one die out of the available pool and
place it into their square in the column. From bottom to top, the other
players take a turn choosing one die out of the available pool and putting
it into their square until all squares in the column are full.

Usually, there will be one unchosen die. That die stays in the available pool.

For every song part in the song, this process is repeated: the starting
player takes 1-3 dice, rolls them into the available pool, then each player
with a square in the column chooses and places a die.

### Counting points from an original song

The circles on the song sheet are what score points for players.

The band starts with one original song with the following circles:

 * Equals - This scores points for the **Beats** player. If the two dice
   adjacent to the circle are equal, add the points from each die. The
   **Beats** player scores that amount.
 * Up arrow - This scores points for the **Melody** player. Subtract the
   *right* die from the *left* die. The **Melody** player scores that amount.
 * Down arrow - This scores points for the **Melody** player. Subtract the
   *left* die from the *right* die. The **Melody** player scores that amount.
 * Crown - This scores points for the **Front** player. Subtract the Front
   die from the lowest of the other dice in the column. The **Front** player
   scores that amount.

Write down each players individual score. Then add each player's score
to the gig score.

### Distributing your gig score points

(If you gain CLOUT, you might unlock new Gig cards - add them to the
"unlocked" Gig deck)


### Distributing your individual score points


## Downtime Phase


## Studio Phase



# Role-playing Variant

In this variant, there is a 4th player, the GM.  Gig cards are removed from
the game and instead, the GM presents the band with each gig scenario, and
declares what goals must be met to get stars or bomb the gig.

# Party Game Variant

This variant plays the same as the regular game, except there are extra
conditions that must be met to get âœ°âœ°âœ° or âœ°âœ°âœ°âœ°:

Once a song has started (the first dice are rolled), only 

 * The **Beats** player must not talk or make any vocal sounds,
   they can only air-drum and tap the table or game components
 * The **Melody** player must not talk or tap the table or components,
   they can only air-guitar and hum
 * The **Front** player has no communication restrictions, but they must
   be kept from seeing the available dice until it's their turn to place
   one (this can be done with hands or a screen)
